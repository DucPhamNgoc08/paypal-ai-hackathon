# PayPal AI Hackathon 2026

Work-in-progress entry for the [PayPal AI Hackathon](https://paypalaihackathon.devpost.com/) (Oct–Nov 2026).

The product idea is not public yet. This repository currently holds the foundation: a Next.js app with the PayPal sandbox and an AI model wired in end to end, tests, and CI.

## What works today

- **PayPal checkout (sandbox):** create an order, send the buyer to PayPal to approve it, capture the payment on return.
- **AI chat endpoint:** sends a prompt to any OpenAI-compatible chat completions API and returns the reply.
- **Runs without keys:** each integration falls back to mock mode when its credentials are missing, shown by a yellow badge on the home page.

## How PayPal is used

| PayPal product / API | Where it is used | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| OAuth 2.0 client credentials | `src/lib/paypal.ts` | Server-side access token |
| Orders API v2 (sandbox) | `src/lib/paypal.ts` | Create and capture payments |

## How AI is used

| Model / AI service | Where it is used | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Any OpenAI-compatible model, set by `AI_MODEL` | `src/lib/ai.ts`, `src/app/api/ai/route.ts` | Chat completions behind a server-side route |

## Architecture

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22.9 or newer
- Optional: a free [PayPal Developer](https://developer.paypal.com/) account (sandbox)
- Optional: an API key for any OpenAI-compatible AI provider

### Run it

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DucPhamNgoc08/paypal-ai-hackathon.git
cd paypal-ai-hackathon
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local   # optional, fill in keys
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000.

### Useful commands

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `npm test` | Unit tests, no network or keys needed |
| `npm run typecheck` | TypeScript check |
| `npm run lint` | ESLint |
| `npm run check:sandbox` | Calls the real PayPal sandbox and AI provider with the keys in `.env.local` and prints a sandbox approval link |

## Security and scope

- Runs against the **PayPal sandbox only**. No real money moves.
- PayPal and AI keys are read on the server (`src/lib/env.ts`) and never sent to the browser.
- `.env.local` is git-ignored; only `.env.example` with empty values is committed.
- Captures send a `PayPal-Request-Id` derived from the order id, so retrying a capture does not charge twice.
- API routes validate input (amount range, currency code, prompt length) and apply a per-IP rate limit, so a public demo cannot be used to burn the AI key. The limit is in-memory, so on serverless hosts it is best-effort.
- Error responses do not echo upstream error bodies; details go to the server log.
