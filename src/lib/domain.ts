// Shared domain types for the relief flow: forecast -> locked rule -> plan -> approval -> payout
// -> partner confirmation -> callback checks -> donor report.
// Types only, no logic, so client components may import this file.

// Conventions:
// - Money is always an integer number of US cents (fields end in `Cents`). Convert to a
//   decimal string only at the PayPal boundary in src/lib/paypal.ts.
// - Timestamps are ISO 8601 strings. Fixtures use the Vietnam offset (+07:00).
// - IDs are strings with a readable prefix, e.g. "hh-qn-01", "partner-hp", "plan-…".
