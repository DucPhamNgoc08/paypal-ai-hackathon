// Plan lifecycle: create a plan from a locked rule, let a person exclude households, and approve
// it once, which sends the Payouts batch. Server-only: it reads and writes the in-memory store.
//
// Amounts always come from src/lib/rules.ts, never from here or from AI. Approval is the only
// place money moves, and it is guarded three ways:
// - the approver sends the plan's current hash, so they approve exactly what they reviewed;
// - a plan is paid at most once: a later approval returns the first result, and approvals that
//   arrive together share one send;
// - a plan total above MAX_PLAN_TOTAL_CENTS is refused, so a public demo cannot drain the
//   sandbox balance.
